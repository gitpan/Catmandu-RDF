NAME
    Catmandu::RDF - Modules for handling RDF data within the Catmandu
    framework

DESCRIPTION
    Catmandu::RDF contains modules for handling RDF data within the Catmandu
    framework. RDF data is encoded/decoded in aREF
    <http://gbv.github.io/aREF/> as implemented with RDF::aREF. Please keep
    in mind that RDF is a graph-based data structuring format with
    specialized technologies such as SPARQL and triple stores. Using
    Catmandu::RDF to transform RDF to RDF (e.g. conversion from one RDF
    serialization to another) is possible but probably less performant than
    decent RDF tools. Catmandu::RDF, however, is more conventient to convert
    between RDF and other data formats.

AVAILABLE MODULES
    Catmandu::Exporter::RDF
        Serialize RDF data (as RDF/XML, RDF/JSON, Turtle, NTriples,
        RDFa...).

    Catmandu::Importer::RDF
        Parse RDF data (RDF/XML, RDF/JSON, Turtle, NTriples...).

SEE ALSO
    This module is based on Catmandu, RDF::aREF, RDF::Trine, and RDF::NS.
